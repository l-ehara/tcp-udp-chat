#What it then does is receiving the message from the client 
#(if he sends any) and broadcasting it to all connected clients. 
#So when one client sends a message, everyone else can see this message.
#Now if for some reason there is an error with the connection to this client,
#we remove it and its nickname, close the connection and broadcast that this 
#client has left the chat. After that we break the loop and this thread comes 
#to an end. Quite simple. We are almost done with the server but we need one final function.
